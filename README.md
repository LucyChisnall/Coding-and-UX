# Coding-and-UX
> For SEO readability the title description and keywords have been included in the head of the site. 
> There is a ‘Skip to Main Content’ included for blind users or anyone using the keyboard to navigate through. This can be accessed when the user ‘tabs’ through the content.
> Favicon included so that it looks professional when viewing in the browser.
> There are anchor links contained within a navigation to allow the usr to quickly skip to a certain section of the page.
> The nav links are underlined to indicate they are clickable. The font weight has been increased to create the best contrast against the background.
> The header background image has been inserted as a background image, as it is only there for aesthetic reasons and therefore will not need to be read by a screen reader. 
> The header image has a background gradient on it to ensure that the contrast is big enough to meet AAA standards.
> All the main content has been put into the <main> tag, so that a screen reader can easily understand what the main area of the web page is. 
> All the proper HTML semantics have been followed Nav, Header, Main, Section & Footer. 
> <em> has been used in the text to ensure that it is emphasised both visually and for screen readers.
> All colours meet AAA standards for colour contrast.
> Links within the copy have maintained the browser rules, so that users understand the common pattern of visited and unvisited links.
> Hover states have been added to clickable elements, so users know what is clickable
> The site responds down to smaller screen sizes, so it is usable to wide reach of users on a variety of devices. 
> The ‘further reading links that scroll off the page on mobile have been positioned so that there should always be one that is cut off mid-way to ensure that the user knows to scroll.
> The links that open in a new tab have been flagged that they do, so that they do not surprise users that were not expecting it. 
> The form has clear labels and placeholder text to help guide the user through.
> The required fields in the form are marked as required with a blue asterisk (*).
> The form sends a response to Formspree, which emails every time it gets a new response. 
> There is a Back to Top CTA that has been added to the end on the main content, so that users can easily navigate bac to the top of the site.
> The majority of units are in rem rather than pixels, as this will allow the site to scale based on the user’s font size that is set.
